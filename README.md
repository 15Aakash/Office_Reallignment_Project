# Office Realignment Optimization – Ram Wireless

This repository contains a two-phase optimization project completed as part of the INFO 645 Prescriptive Analytics course at Virginia Commonwealth University.

## Objective
Reassign stores to four regional offices (Staunton, Richmond, Warrenton, and Tappahannock) in a way that minimizes travel costs and respects operational capacity constraints for various business functions.

## Project Phases

### Phase I: Distance-Based Feasibility Model
- Tools Used: Excel Solver
- Goal: Assign each store to the nearest regional office based solely on mileage.
- Outcome: Model resulted in low travel cost but was infeasible due to workload imbalance.

### Phase II: Optimization with Constraints
- Tools Used: Python (AMPLpy), AMPL, CBC Solver, Google Colab
- Goal: Minimize total travel cost while ensuring workload feasibility across offices.
- Outcome: Achieved feasible and cost-efficient store-to-office assignment with model refinements.
